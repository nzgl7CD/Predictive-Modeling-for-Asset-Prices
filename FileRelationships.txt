The architecture to set up the Predictive Modeling for Asset Prices project into four main stages: 
Data Collection, Data Processing & Feature Engineering, Modeling & Training, and Evaluation & Reporting. Each stage has specific components 
to guide you, keeping things streamlined yet flexible for later expansion.

1. Data Collection
Source & Database: Start with an API like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl to fetch historical data. Focus on daily or hourly price 
data to simplify the setup.
Data Storage: Use a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite) to store and organize historical data. This will make it easier to 
query specific time frames or add more assets later.
Automated Pipeline (Optional): Use Python scripts with CRON jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to automate daily updates if you want 
fresh data regularly.
2. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Data Wrangling: Use Pandas to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and convert data into a time-series format.
Feature Engineering:
Technical Indicators: Add moving averages (SMA, EMA), volatility measures (e.g., Bollinger Bands), and momentum indicators (e.g., RSI).
Lagged Features: Create lagged returns (e.g., one-day, one-week returns) to capture temporal patterns.
Rolling Windows: Calculate rolling averages or volatility over specific time windows.
Data Normalization: Use MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler from scikit-learn to scale features, which is essential for many machine learning models.
3. Modeling & Training
Model Selection: Start with a basic model like Linear Regression or Random Forest. These are easy to interpret and provide a baseline for more 
advanced models.
Advanced Models (Optional): If you want to explore more complexity, try Gradient Boosting (using XGBoost or LightGBM) or LSTM networks for 
capturing temporal dependencies if you’re familiar with deep learning.
Model Pipeline: Use scikit-learn’s Pipeline to streamline preprocessing and modeling in one flow, so you can efficiently test various models 
and parameters.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for your chosen models.
4. Evaluation & Reporting
Evaluation Metrics: Use time-series-specific metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
Also, evaluate out-of-sample performance with a rolling or expanding window to simulate real trading conditions.
Backtesting (Optional): For additional insight, use a library like Backtrader to backtest predictions on historical data to see how well they 
translate to trading signals.
Visualizations: Create visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot predictions against actual prices and display key metrics.
Reporting: A Jupyter notebook or PDF report detailing the methodology, results, and key findings is useful for demonstrating your process and 
insights.

Tools Summary:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
Database (optional): PostgreSQL or SQLite
APIs: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl
